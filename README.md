# Sorting Visualization Tool

This project allows for one to view visualizations of common sorting algorithms. This project is a simple static website that was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A larger screen size is better, but this sorting visualization tool can be used on both desktop and mobile web browsers.

A live build of this project can be found [here](https://debecerra.github.io/Sorting-Visualization-Tool).

## Instructions and Description

The visualization tool is designed to be very simple and straightforward to use. Choose a sorting algorithm from the toolbar at the top of the screen. In the text input field, enter the number of elements you want to sort (max 100, min 5). The default number of elements is 20. Once these parameters have been set, click "sort" to view the selected sorting algorithm in action. A sorted array can be randomized by clicking on "reset."

As the array is being sorted, array elements will change colors to represent the action being performed. The default state is represented by the color yellow, which means that no action is being performed on that element. When two array elements are being swapped, both array elements will flash red. When elements have been placed in their final position (either absolute or relative depending on the algorithm), their color will change to green. That is, the green array elements will indicate the portion of the array that has already been sorted. Once the entire array has been sorted, all elements in the array will be displayed with the color green.
